Like that of Earth, Venusian core is most likely at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling at about the same rate.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus#Internal_structure"},"geology":{"content":"Much of the Venusian surface appears to have been shaped by volcanic activity.

It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn"},"structure":{"content":"Despite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn\'s mass is not in the gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 0.01 g/cm3, which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn\'s mass.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn#Internal_structure"},"geology":{"content":"The outer atmosphere of Saturn contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25% helium by volume.
